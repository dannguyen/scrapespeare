<A NAME=speech1><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:</A><br>
<A NAME=2>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;</A><br>
<A NAME=3>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</A><br>
<A NAME=4>What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,</A><br>
<A NAME=5>I am to learn;</A><br>
<A NAME=6>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>That I have much ado to know myself.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</A><br>
<A NAME=9>There, where your argosies with portly sail,</A><br>
<A NAME=10>Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Do overpeer the petty traffickers,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=15>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>The better part of my affections would</A><br>
<A NAME=17>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;</A><br>
<A NAME=20>And every object that might make me fear</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Would make me sad.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=23>                  My wind cooling my broth</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</A><br>
<A NAME=25>What harm a wind too great at sea might do.</A><br>
<A NAME=26>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs</A><br>
<A NAME=30>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</A><br>
<A NAME=31>And see the holy edifice of stone,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</A><br>
<A NAME=38>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</A><br>
<A NAME=39>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</A><br>
<A NAME=40>But tell not me; I know, Antonio</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</A><br>
<A NAME=45>Upon the fortune of this present year:</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=47>Why, then you are in love.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=48>Fie, fie!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=49>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy</A><br>
<A NAME=51>For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes</A><br>
<A NAME=55>And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,</A><br>
<A NAME=56>And other of such vinegar aspect</A><br>
<A NAME=57>That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:</A><br>
<A NAME=61>We leave you now with better company.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>If worthier friends had not prevented me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>Your worth is very dear in my regard.</A><br>
<A NAME=65>I take it, your own business calls on you</A><br>
<A NAME=66>And you embrace the occasion to depart.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>Good morrow, my good lords.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>BASSANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=68>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?</A><br>
<A NAME=69>You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=70>We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt Salarino and Salanio</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>LORENZO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</A><br>
<A NAME=72>We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>BASSANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=74>I will not fail you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>GRATIANO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=75>You look not well, Signior Antonio;</A><br>
<A NAME=76>You have too much respect upon the world:</A><br>
<A NAME=77>They lose it that do buy it with much care:</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Believe me, you are marvellously changed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=79>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;</A><br>
<A NAME=80>A stage where every man must play a part,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>And mine a sad one.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>GRATIANO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=82>Let me play the fool:</A><br>
<A NAME=83>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</A><br>
<A NAME=84>And let my liver rather heat with wine</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice</A><br>
<A NAME=89>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--</A><br>
<A NAME=90>I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--</A><br>
<A NAME=91>There are a sort of men whose visages</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</A><br>
<A NAME=93>And do a wilful stillness entertain,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</A><br>
<A NAME=96>As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,</A><br>
<A NAME=97>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'</A><br>
<A NAME=98>O my Antonio, I do know of these</A><br>
<A NAME=99>That therefore only are reputed wise</A><br>
<A NAME=100>For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.</A><br>
<A NAME=103>I'll tell thee more of this another time:</A><br>
<A NAME=104>But fish not, with this melancholy bait,</A><br>
<A NAME=105>For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.</A><br>
<A NAME=106>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:</A><br>
<A NAME=107>I'll end my exhortation after dinner.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>LORENZO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=108>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:</A><br>
<A NAME=109>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>For Gratiano never lets me speak.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>GRATIANO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=111>Well, keep me company but two years moe,</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=113>Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>GRATIANO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=114>Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable</A><br>
<A NAME=115>In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=116>Is that any thing now?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>BASSANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=117>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more</A><br>
<A NAME=118>than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two</A><br>
<A NAME=119>grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you</A><br>
<A NAME=120>shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you</A><br>
<A NAME=121>have them, they are not worth the search.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=122>Well, tell me now what lady is the same</A><br>
<A NAME=123>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,</A><br>
<A NAME=124>That you to-day promised to tell me of?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>BASSANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=125>'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</A><br>
<A NAME=126>How much I have disabled mine estate,</A><br>
<A NAME=127>By something showing a more swelling port</A><br>
<A NAME=128>Than my faint means would grant continuance:</A><br>
<A NAME=129>Nor do I now make moan to be abridged</A><br>
<A NAME=130>From such a noble rate; but my chief care</A><br>
<A NAME=131>Is to come fairly off from the great debts</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Wherein my time something too prodigal</A><br>
<A NAME=133>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,</A><br>
<A NAME=134>I owe the most, in money and in love,</A><br>
<A NAME=135>And from your love I have a warranty</A><br>
<A NAME=136>To unburden all my plots and purposes</A><br>
<A NAME=137>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=138>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</A><br>
<A NAME=139>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</A><br>
<A NAME=140>Within the eye of honour, be assured,</A><br>
<A NAME=141>My purse, my person, my extremest means,</A><br>
<A NAME=142>Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>BASSANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=143>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</A><br>
<A NAME=144>I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</A><br>
<A NAME=145>The self-same way with more advised watch,</A><br>
<A NAME=146>To find the other forth, and by adventuring both</A><br>
<A NAME=147>I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,</A><br>
<A NAME=148>Because what follows is pure innocence.</A><br>
<A NAME=149>I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,</A><br>
<A NAME=150>That which I owe is lost; but if you please</A><br>
<A NAME=151>To shoot another arrow that self way</A><br>
<A NAME=152>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</A><br>
<A NAME=153>As I will watch the aim, or to find both</A><br>
<A NAME=154>Or bring your latter hazard back again</A><br>
<A NAME=155>And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=156>You know me well, and herein spend but time</A><br>
<A NAME=157>To wind about my love with circumstance;</A><br>
<A NAME=158>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</A><br>
<A NAME=159>In making question of my uttermost</A><br>
<A NAME=160>Than if you had made waste of all I have:</A><br>
<A NAME=161>Then do but say to me what I should do</A><br>
<A NAME=162>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</A><br>
<A NAME=163>And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>BASSANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=164>In Belmont is a lady richly left;</A><br>
<A NAME=165>And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,</A><br>
<A NAME=166>Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes</A><br>
<A NAME=167>I did receive fair speechless messages:</A><br>
<A NAME=168>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued</A><br>
<A NAME=169>To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:</A><br>
<A NAME=170>Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</A><br>
<A NAME=171>For the four winds blow in from every coast</A><br>
<A NAME=172>Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</A><br>
<A NAME=173>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;</A><br>
<A NAME=174>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,</A><br>
<A NAME=175>And many Jasons come in quest of her.</A><br>
<A NAME=176>O my Antonio, had I but the means</A><br>
<A NAME=177>To hold a rival place with one of them,</A><br>
<A NAME=178>I have a mind presages me such thrift,</A><br>
<A NAME=179>That I should questionless be fortunate!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=180>Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;</A><br>
<A NAME=181>Neither have I money nor commodity</A><br>
<A NAME=182>To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;</A><br>
<A NAME=183>Try what my credit can in Venice do:</A><br>
<A NAME=184>That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,</A><br>
<A NAME=185>To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.</A><br>
<A NAME=186>Go, presently inquire, and so will I,</A><br>
<A NAME=187>Where money is, and I no question make</A><br>
<A NAME=188>To have it of my trust or for my sake.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>

<p><i>Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>PORTIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=190>By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of</A><br>
<A NAME=191>this great world.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>NERISSA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=192>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in</A><br>
<A NAME=193>the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and</A><br>
<A NAME=194>yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit</A><br>
<A NAME=195>with too much as they that starve with nothing. It</A><br>
<A NAME=196>is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the</A><br>
<A NAME=197>mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but</A><br>
<A NAME=198>competency lives longer.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>PORTIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=199>Good sentences and well pronounced.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>NERISSA</b></a>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>PORTIA</b></a>

<A NAME=201>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to</A><br>
<A NAME=202>do, chapels had been churches and poor men's</A><br>
<A NAME=203>cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that</A><br>
<A NAME=204>follows his own instructions: I can easier teach</A><br>
<A NAME=205>twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the</A><br>
<A NAME=206>twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may</A><br>
<A NAME=207>devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps</A><br>
<A NAME=208>o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the</A><br>
<A NAME=209>youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the</A><br>
<A NAME=210>cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to</A><br>
<A NAME=211>choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may</A><br>
<A NAME=212>neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I</A><br>
<A NAME=213>dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed</A><br>
<A NAME=214>by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,</A><br>

<A NAME=273>he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and</A><br>
<A NAME=274>when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:</A><br>
<A NAME=275>and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall</A><br>
<A NAME=276>make shift to go without him.</A><br>

<A NAME=speech52><b>NERISSA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=277>If he should offer to choose, and choose the right</A><br>
<A NAME=278>casket, you should refuse to perform your father's</A><br>
<A NAME=279>will, if you should refuse to accept him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech53><b>PORTIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=280>Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a</A><br>
<A NAME=281>deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,</A><br>
<A NAME=282>for if the devil be within and that temptation</A><br>
<A NAME=283>without, I know he will choose it. I will do any</A><br>
<A NAME=284>thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech54><b>NERISSA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=285>You need not fear, lady, the having any of these</A><br>
<A NAME=286>lords: they have acquainted me with their</A><br>
<A NAME=287>determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their</A><br>
<A NAME=288>home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless</A><br>
<A NAME=289>you may be won by some other sort than your father's</A><br>
<A NAME=290>imposition depending on the caskets.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech55><b>PORTIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=291>If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as</A><br>
<A NAME=292>chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner</A><br>
<A NAME=293>of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers</A><br>
<A NAME=294>are so reasonable, for there is not one among them</A><br>
<A NAME=295>but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant</A><br>
<A NAME=296>them a fair departure.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech56><b>NERISSA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=297>Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a</A><br>
<A NAME=298>Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither</A><br>

<A NAME=speech57><b>PORTIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=300>Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.</A><br>

<A NAME=speech58><b>NERISSA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=301>True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish</A><br>
<A NAME=302>eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.</A><br>

<A NAME=305>How now! what news?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech60><b>Servant</b></a>

<A NAME=309>prince his master will be here to-night.</A><br>

<A NAME=310>If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a</A><br>
<A NAME=311>heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should</A><br>
<A NAME=312>be glad of his approach: if he have the condition</A><br>
<A NAME=313>of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had</A><br>
<A NAME=314>rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,</A><br>
<A NAME=315>Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.</A><br>
<A NAME=316>Whiles we shut the gates</A><br>

The Life and Death of Julies Caesar
ACT 5, SCENE 2
SCENE II. The same. The field of battle.

[Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA]

    BRUTUS:
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
Unto the legions on the other side.
Let them set on at once; for I perceive
But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
[Loud alarum]
[Exeunt]
